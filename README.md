- An web app designed for my vacation to Taipei, Taiwan in Year 2019
- Built with Python (Flask), Bootstrap, PostgreSQL

- Aim of the web app:
=> to provide me and my travel mate with easy access to the restaurants of Taipei I saved in my database
=> Add in new restaurants to the database
=> marked/unmarked Favorite restaurants

* All the restaurant pages include link to Google map, which can provide navigation when needed.

- The "Travel Plan" page include some informative links, such as:
=> Online booking receipt of restaurants
=>Travel/Food blog relevant to the respective attraction/restaurant
=> Link to check flight status at Taoyuan International airport (so that I won't miss my flight !!! )
